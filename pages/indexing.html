                        <p class="textop">Enterocytes are cells that line most of the small intestine, covering more than 80% of its length. They belong to the group of intestinal epithelial cells and their main function is to digest and absorb nutrients, transporting them to other parts of the body.
                            These cells are polarized, meaning they differ in height, composition, and functionality between their ends. In addition, they form an essential immune barrier for the protection of the body.
                            Enterocytes originate from stem cells located in the intestinal crypts and move to the villi, where they perform their functions. Their lifespan is short, lasting from 4 to 5 days in humans, and they are constantly being renewed.
                            On the apical surface of enterocytes is the brush border, composed of microvilli. This is where the digestive enzymes responsible for breaking down carbohydrates and proteins are anchored.
                            In addition to participating in digestion, enterocytes also control what enters the bloodstream, acting as a selective filter that protects the body against harmful substances and microorganisms. Finally, they also produce digestive enzymes that contribute to the breakdown of food in the intestine.
