                    <p class="paragrafo">The nucleus is the region of the cell where the genetic material of eukaryotic organisms is found. It performs various functions, some of which include controlling cell activities, storing genetic information, and synthesizing and processing mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA. It is composed of a nuclear envelope, nucleoplasm, and nucleolus.</p>

                    <p class="paragrafo">The Golgi complex, or Golgi apparatus, is a cellular organelle involved in the secretion of substances. Other functions of this complex include the processing of lipids and proteins, as well as the formation of the acrosome, which is located at the head of the sperm. This structure is formed by flattened and stacked membranous sacs. The structure is divided into two sides: the trans side, which is concave and directed towards the plasma membrane and is connected to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and the cis side, which is directed towards the plasma membrane and is concave.</p>

                        <p class="paragrafo">Mitochondria are organelles found only in eukaryotic cells. Their function is to provide most of the energy for cells. The size, shape, and quantity of mitochondria vary according to cell type, and they have their own genetic material. Mitochondria are formed by two membranes, one external and one internal. The external membrane is smooth and composed of lipids and proteins, which control the entry of molecules, while the internal membrane is less permeable and has many folds.</p>

                    </div>  
                    <p class="paragrafo">The smooth endoplasmic reticulum has ribosomes on its surface and is shaped like interconnected cylindrical tubes. Inside it, fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol are synthesized, and it stores calcium levels.

                    </div>  
                    <p class="paragrafo">Unlike the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the rough endoplasmic reticulum has ribosomes attached to its surface and consists of branched, flatter channels. The ribosomes present in the membrane synthesize proteins that are thrown into the interior of the organelle. In addition, the RER participates in processes such as phospholipid production, glycosylation, and membrane protein synthesis.

                    </div>  
                    <p class="paragrafo">Ribosomes are structures related to protein synthesis. Regardless of where ribosomes are located in the cell, they act in protein synthesis. The main difference lies in where these proteins will be destined.

                    </div>  
                    <p class="paragrafo">Lysosomes are cellular organelles filled with enzymes that act in intracellular digestion. They can digest materials from outside the cell 
or structures from within the cell itself. Their structure is delimited by a lipoprotein layer.
